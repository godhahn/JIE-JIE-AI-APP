# JIE JIE AI APP
## JIE JIE AI APP is a repository where I experiment and develop small projects based on my sister's requests. These projects are crafted using Python and Streamlit, and they integrate with the Groq API and LLaMA models to enhance their capabilities. Each project consists of interactive applications designed to be intuitive, ensuring accessibility even for those with minimal technical expertise.

## Key Apps:
1. Productivity and Task Planning AI: A streamlined AI-powered task planner integrated into sticky notes, helping you prioritize and organize tasks while providing recommendations on how to complete them efficiently.
2. Sustainability and Money Saving AI: A chatbot that offers tailored advice on sustainable practices and money-saving strategies based on user queries.

Feel free to explore the code, contribute, or raise issues if you encounter any challenges!
